#  Tipsy

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get comfortable with the creation of multi-screen apps through the use of segues

## What I created

I created a beautiful bill splitting, tip calculating app. No one can work out $145.56 split between 5 people with a 20 percent tip. With your very own Tipsy app in hand, youâ€™ll never need to do maths ever again!


## What I learned
* How to implement multi view apps with segues
* Using auto layout to create beautiful looking apps on any size screen
* Advanced swift programming concepts
